# AI-Powered Resume Screener

A demo application that showcases how artificial intelligence can automate and enhance the recruitment process by analyzing resumes and matching them to job requirements.

## Features

- **Smart Resume Analysis**: Simulates AI-powered analysis of resumes to extract skills and qualifications
- **Job Requirements Matching**: Compares candidate skills against job requirements to find the best matches
- **Match Scoring**: Assigns a percentage match score to each candidate based on their qualifications
- **Resume Upload**: Supports drag-and-drop upload of resume files or direct text input
- **Results Dashboard**: Displays applicants sorted by match score with detailed analysis
- **Recruitment Statistics**: Shows time saved and efficiency metrics

## How It Works

1. **Define Job Requirements**: Enter the job title, description, and required skills
2. **Upload Resumes**: Drag and drop files or paste resume text
3. **AI Analysis**: The system parses resumes to extract information (simulated in this demo)
4. **Matching Algorithm**: Candidates are scored based on how well they match the requirements
5. **Review Results**: View details about each candidate including match percentage and skill analysis

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Responsive design for use on any device
- No backend required (demo simulates API calls)

## Demo Limitations

This is a front-end demonstration of how AI could transform recruitment:

- Resume parsing is simulated (in a real app, this would use NLP and machine learning)
- The matching algorithm uses basic keyword matching (real systems would use more sophisticated analysis)
- File upload handling doesn't actually parse PDFs/DOCs (real systems would use specialized parsers)

## How AI is Transforming Recruitment

### Efficiency
AI can screen hundreds of resumes in seconds, reducing the time-to-hire by up to 75%. Recruiters can focus on interviewing qualified candidates rather than manually reviewing applications.

### Bias Reduction
By focusing on skills and qualifications rather than demographic information, AI-powered screening can help reduce unconscious bias in the hiring process.

### Better Matches
Advanced algorithms can identify candidates whose experience and skills best match job requirements, leading to better hires and lower turnover.

### Data-Driven Decisions
Gain insights into your candidate pool and recruitment trends with detailed analytics, helping organizations refine their hiring strategies over time.

## Future Enhancements

In a real-world implementation, this system could be expanded with:

- Integration with applicant tracking systems
- Advanced NLP for deeper resume understanding
- Interview scheduling and automated communication
- Predictive analytics for candidate success
- Support for multilingual resumes
- Customizable matching criteria and weights
